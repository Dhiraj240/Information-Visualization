# JSON File Creation
To visualize the JSON data using **D3.js** i had created a jsonfile first i created a ```csv``` file which contains id, name, description, category of any kind.
<br>
*Convert the ```csv``` file to ```json``` file using the ```jsonconverter.py``` *
<br>
 *Run```python jsonconverter.py``` in terrminal and it generates ```jsondata.json``` file. *

# Visualize the created JSON data via D3.js
I used the [D3.js opensource](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery) to come to a conclusion on generating the following visualization.
The visualization provides the comparision of id, name, description on pie char as how many have been regiistered with unique ids and consistent names, descriptions.
The ```JSON data``` was written manually as ```d3.json()``` is not working by the community itself.They are working to solve this bug for hierarchical json fields.
I have alloted different unconsistent names and description.
Following is the screenshot of it.
